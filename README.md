## 🧠 About Me

I'm a **3rd-year B.Tech Electronics Engineering student** at **Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology (RGIPT)**, passionate about VLSI design, circuit simulation, and embedded systems.

My focus lies in the **RTL-to-GDS-II physical design flow** — from logic synthesis and floorplanning all the way through routing, Static Timing Analysis (STA), and physical verification. I enjoy bridging the gap between theoretical circuit design and real-world chip implementation.

- 🔬 Currently exploring: **SRAM design, MOSFET-level circuits, and VLSI physical design**
- 🛠️ Tools I work with: **LTSpice, Cadence/Synopsys flow, Arduino**
- 📚 Strong foundation in: **Digital & Analog Circuits, Solid-State Devices, Control Systems**
- 🤝 Open to: **VLSI internships, research collaborations, and open-source hardware projects**
