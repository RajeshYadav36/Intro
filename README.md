## 🧠 About Me

I'm a **B.Tech Electronics Engineering student** at **Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology (RGIPT)**, specializing in **VLSI Physical Design, FPGA Development, and DSP/Communications**.

I've completed a full **RTL-to-GDS-II tape-out of a 32-bit RISC-V processor** using open-source EDA tools in 180nm technology, and I'm currently working on an **Adaptive Kalman Filter-based BPSK Demodulator** targeting FPGA/VLSI deployment for deep-space communication.

- ⚙️ Focused on: **ASIC Physical Design, RTL to GDS-II, RISC-V Microarchitecture, FPGA**
- 🔭 Currently building: **Adaptive Kalman Filter for BPSK demodulation (FPGA/VLSI-ready)**
- 🛠️ EDA Stack: **QFlow · Yosys · Magic · OpenSTA · Vivado · LTSpice · ModelSim**
- 🌱 Open to: **VLSI Internships · RISC-V Research · FPGA Projects · DSP Collaborations**
